**Because we are using fake data on this branch, the Observational Completeness Function we are assuming to be 1**

I have updated this folder after realizing thta the Normalization factor is something that **MUST**  be included in even the most simple versions

The Files in this Folder are described by the following:

Most_Simple_Power_Law_Distribution_Fitting: 
NO Schectar Function, only fitting the Power Law alpha parameter. 

Schectar_Function:
Schectar Function Fitting Including M_c claculations
