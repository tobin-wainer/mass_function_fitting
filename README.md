# mass_function_fitting

This is the Git location that I will be using for my work trying to fit the Mass function for Star Clusters in M33.

I will be utilizing MCMC simulations to fit both a Schechtar function and power law distributions to the data to see which provides a better fit. 

**This Branch is a FAKE DATA set where I have created a power law distribution to test the code**

The Analysis will follow that of Johnson et. al 2017 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...839...78J

The M31_MF_replication folder is proof of concept where I am testing the code I wrote against the results from M31.
In this is a README file that explains each of the Jupyter Notebooks

I will then push the final working code to the main repository to use on M33 data.
