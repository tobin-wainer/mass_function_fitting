**Because we are using fake data on this branch, the Observational Completeness Function we are assuming to be 1**

I have updated this folder after realizing thta the Normalization factor is something that **MUST**  be included in even the most simple versions

The Files in this Folder are described by the following:

Most_Simple_Power_Law_Distribution_Fitting:  NO Schectar Function, only fitting the Power Law alpha parameter. 
Most Simple becasue we are assumiong that the Observational Completeness Function is 1 due to Fake-Data

Moast_Simple_Schectar_Function: Schectar Function Fitting Including M_c parameter claculations. 
Most Simple becasue we are assumiong that the Observational Completeness Function is 1 due to Fake-Data
